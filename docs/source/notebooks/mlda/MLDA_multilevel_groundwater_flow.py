# # Multilevel Groundwater Flow with MLDA
#
# NOTE: This script has been converted from the python notebook in
# pymc3/docs/source/notebooks/MLDA_multilevel_groundwater_flow.ipynb.
# Supporting utility code for the forward model is located in pymc3/docs/source/notebooks/mlda.
#
#
# The MLDA sampler
# This notebook (along with the utility code within the `./mlda` folder) is designed to
# demonstrate the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance MCMC algorithm (MLDA) proposed in [1], as implemented within pymc3.
# 
# The MLDA sampler can be more efficient than other MCMC samplers when dealing with computationally intensive
# problems where we have access not only to the desired (fine) posterior distribution but also to a set of
# approximate (coarse) posteriors of decreasing accuracy and decreasing computational cost.
# 
# This is the case e.g. in subsurface flow models where a partial differential equation (PDE) with highly varying
# coefficients needs to be solved numerically on a fine spatial grid to perform each MCMC likelihood computation. If
# we have access to versions of the same model on coarser grids, we can apply a multilevel approach; in simple terms,
# we can use multiple chains on different coarseness levels and coarser chains' samples are used as proposals for the
# finer chains. This has been shown to improve the effective sample size of the finest chain and this allows us to
# reduce the number of expensive fine-chain likelihood evaluations.
# 
# For more details about the MLDA sampler and the way it should be used and parameterised, the user can refer to the
# code below, as well as the docstrings within the python code (the implementation is under
# `pymc3/pymc3/step_methods/metropolis.py`).
# 
# Please note that the MLDA sampler is new in pymc3. The user should be extra critical about the results and report
# any problems as issues in the pymc3's github repository.
# 
# The model
# Within this notebook, a simple MLDA sampler is compared to pymc3's Metropolis MCMC sampler. The
# target posterior is defined within the context of a Bayesian inverse problem for groundwater flow modeling,
# where we solve a PDE in each likelihood evaluation and we are able to do this in different coarseness levels.
# 
# The example demonstrates that MLDA is more efficient than Metropolis when measured by the Effective Samples per
# Second they can generate from the posterior. MLDA's relative efficiency becomes even larger when the size of the
# problem (i.e. fine resolution, number of parameters) increases. The user is encouraged to try different sizes,
# since the ones used here are moderate to avoid long runtimes. Note that the likelihood in this example cannot be
# automatically differentiated therefore NUTS cannot be used.
# 
# PDE solver details
# The code within the `./mlda` folder solves the steady state groundwater flow problem for a
# random hydraulic conductivity field [2]. This solution acts as the forward model in the context of a Bayesian
# Inverse problem. In conjunction with MCMC, this setup allows for sampling from the posterior distribution of model
# parameters (hydraulic conductivity) given data (measurements of hydraulic head). This setup has applications in
# hydrogeological parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. The forward model can work in differing levels
# of coarseness, allowing us to use a multilevel approach.
# 
# Note that the solver uses "black box" code from an external C++ library (FEniCS [3]) which needs to be installed
# before running the notebook.
# 
# The files within `./mlda` contain the following:
# 
# `GwFlow.py`: This module is a FEniCS implementation of steady state groundwater flow in a confined aquifer,
# an elliptic Partial Differential Equation (PDE). It creates a mesh on a unit square domain, given the input
# resolution, imposes fixed head boundary conditions of 1 and 0 at left and right boundaries, respectively,
# and no-flow boundary conditions at the top and bottom boundaries. It then solves the problem given some FEniCS [3]
# function, representative of heterogeneous, isotropic hydraulic conductivity.
# 
# `RandomProcess.py`: This module generates realisations of a Gaussian Random Field with a squared exponential
# covariance function, as described in [2], representative of the (unknown) aquifer conductivity field. It takes a n
# x d matrix of nodal coordinates, a covariance length scale and a truncation parameter k, and computes the k
# largest Karhunen–Loève (KL) eigenmodes of the covariance matrix. It then generates random field realisations
# according to the mean and standard deviation of the desired log-conductivity field and a vector of random parameters.
# 
# `Model.py`: A module that wraps the groundwater flow solver and random process into one object. When the
# solve-method is called, it will solve the groundwater flow problem given a vector of random field parameters. The
# user can then extract hydraulic heads at datapoints using the get_data-method.
# 
# 
# Dependencies
# The code has been developed and tested with Python 3.6. You will need to have pymc3 installed and
# also install [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) for your system.
